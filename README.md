# 🫶🏻 Hi I'm Salma!

Welcome to my space. I'm currently a student at UTD majoring in Data Science. 
I am currently in the process of learning how to use tools such as R and Python 
in order to use them in my work everyday. My goal is to eventually use these tools
to answer questions and learn more about the world around me.

I hope you enjoy your time in my cozy space 🦭

## Fun Facts 🪷

1. Once I graduate, my goal is to specialize in social data analytics and research, and
I hope to align my studies accordingly. Learning more about the people around me is a personal
dream!

2. When I'm not solving math problems or coding, I'm usually playing video games. I am currently
playing through **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom**. 

3. I have traveled to at least five different countries: Germany, the United Kingdom, Turkey,
Tunisia, and Libya (my home land! 🇱🇾)

## Current Programs

C/C++, Java, R, Python
